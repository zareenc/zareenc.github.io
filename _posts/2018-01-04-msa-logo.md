title: "MSA Rebranding: Alchemist and Skyline"
date: 2018-01-04

The past few months, I had the exciting opportunity to help redesign the [MIT MSA](http://msa.mit.edu/) (Muslim Students' Association) brand. While I've dabbled in casual digital artwork, mostly in Photoshop, this was the first time I worked on a relatively large project and my first time using Illustrator. I thought I would share our rebranding process and a bit of what I learned to do in Illustrator at a high level.

Many people complained that the original MSA logo was not very aesthetically pleasing, particularly noting the jarring green color and blocky font. The MSA exec committee collectively agreed it was high time to change our branding, so those interested came together to form a Rebranding subcommittee. 

Our first step was to send out a survey and identify what people wanted to see in the redesign. Based on survey results, we found that people wanted a simple and aesthetically pleasing logo with a clean color scheme. Additionally, they wanted it to convey a message, such as community, faith, inclusiveness, and faith. Many suggested incorporating elements representing both Islam and MIT. 

With this in mind, each of us in the Rebranding committee brainstormed new logo ideas on our own and shared proposed designs. We then downselected for logos that had a clean design & pleasing aesthetics, and were representative of the intersectional experience of being Muslim and an MIT student. We wanted to ensure that our logo was unique to our organization, and could not just as easily represent another MIT or Muslim group. Two of my ideas - the Alchemist and the Skyline - were selected for developing, so it was time to start designing!

### Alchemist
One of the more memorable figures on MIT's campus is the [Alchemist](https://listart.mit.edu/public-art-map/alchemist) by [Jaume Plensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaume_Plensa). Plensa has created a number of similar sister figures throughout the world ([*House of Memory*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/house-of-memory-2012), [*Singapore Soul*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/soul-2011), [*El Alma del Ebro*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/el-alma-del-ebro-2008), [*Nomade*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/nomade-2007)). However, the one at MIT is unique in its formation of a thinking man with numbers and mathematical symbols, as opposed to letters of the alphabet. My Alchemist design combines this well-recognized landmark of MIT with symbols of Islam, by replacing the mathematical symbols with Arabic letters.

My next step was to transform this idea into an actual design. I had never used Illustrator before, so I learned as I went along. Luckily, the Alchemist design ended up being fairly straightforward. I first created a [clipping mask](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/clipping-masks.html) from an image of the Alchemist's profile and overlaid it on a black background. 

Next I had to add the Arabic characters. I tested several different Arabic fonts, ranging from more calligraphic like Waseem to more playful like [Farah Regular](https://www.fonts.com/font/diwan-software/farah/regular). I simply inserted, transformed, and rotated individual characters onto the mask. Finally, I used the [paintbrush tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/brushes.html#paintbrush_tool_options) with a rounded tip to freehand "MSA" in [MIT's red color](http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/colors.html). I opted to freehand the lettering to create a casual and playful vibe.

With a few more adjustments and feedback, like [smoothing the path](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/editing-paths.html), the final Alchemist logo was ready. The MSA exec committee opted to use this design for our swag this year - crewnecks and stickers - and they came out really nicely. Check it out below!

### Skyline
MIT's skyline is an undeniably quirky, yet cherished image that is all too familiar to every MIT student. In fact, it's featured on the [Brass Rat](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/history-of-the-brass-rat) every year. My Skyline design for the MSA reimagines the traditional MIT skyline with classic Islamic architectural elements, including domes, arches, minarets, and a crescent moon. The image represents a home, or community, that lies at the intersection of life at MIT and life as a Muslim, much like the Alchemist. 

<!-- TODO: add picture of skyline and sketch --> 

To develop the Skyline design, I primarily relied on Illustrator's [shaper tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/building-new-shapes-using-shape.html), which provides a very intuitive way to build, join, and delete shapes. Using basic shapes - rectangles, circles, triangles - as building blocks, I built a first iteration of the Skyline featuring MIT's most recognizable buildings (left to right): [Kresge Auditorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresge_Auditorium), the [Infinite Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Corridor) including the [Great Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_of_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#Maclaurin_Buildings_and_Great_Dome_(1916)), the [Green Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_(MIT)), and the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba) as a stand in for the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). 

<!-- TODO: add picture of initial design --> 

Over the next several weeks, we went through dozens of iterations based on solicited feedback. I added more negative space to the Green building using the subtraction functionality of the [shaper tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/building-new-shapes-using-shape.html). I redesigned Kresge to look more realistic by creating a [clipping mask](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/clipping-masks.html) of an image of the building, then slicing the roof with the [knife tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/cutting-dividing-objects.html#Toolsforcuttinganddividingobjects) for added negative space. I replaced the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba) with a simplified design of the [Stata Center](http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/stata.html). I remade the Infinite Corridor to more accurately represent the shape and dimensions of the dome and the pillars. I played around with color schemes and minified versions of the logo. 

<!-- TODO: add gif or row or images --> 

After many rounds of iteration, the final logo was settled on! The MSA exec plans to transition to using this logo for all official branding from now on.

I'm very happy with how both the designs turned out, and thankful for all the feedback that helped transform the logos into their final forms. Special shout out to Habiba, Dana, Rahma, Mariam, Yara, Efe, and the entire MSA exec committee. This was a very exciting opportunity for me to dip my feet into the world of Illustrator, and I'm looking forward to playing with digital artwork more. Feel free to reach out to me with comments, feedback, or project ideas you're interested in working on!
