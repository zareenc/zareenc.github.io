title: "MSA Rebranding: Alchemist and Skyline"

The past few months, I had the exciting opportunity to help redesign the [MIT MSA](http://msa.mit.edu/) (Muslim Students' Association) brand. While I've dabbled in casual digital artwork, mostly in Photoshop, this was the first time I worked on a relatively large project and my first time using Illustrator. I thought I would share our rebranding process and a bit of what I learned to do in Illustrator at a high level.

Many people complained that the original MSA logo was not very aesthetically pleasing, particularly noting the jarring green color and blocky font. The MSA exec committee collectively agreed it was high time to change our branding, so those interested came together to form a Rebranding subcommittee. 

Our first step was to send out a survey and identify what people wanted to see in the redesign. Based on survey results, we found that people wanted a simple and aesthetically pleasing logo with a clean color scheme. Additionally, they wanted it to convey a message, such as community, faith, inclusiveness, and faith. Many suggested incorporating elements representing both Islam and MIT. 

With this in mind, each of us in the Rebranding committee brainstormed new logo ideas on our own and shared proposed designs. We then downselected for logos that had a clean design & pleasing aesthetics, and were representative of the intersectional experience of being Muslim and an MIT student. We wanted to ensure that our logo was unique to our organization, and could not just as easily represent another MIT or Muslim group. Two of my ideas - the Alchemist and the Skyline - were selected for developing, so it was time to start designing!

### Alchemist
One of the more memorable figures on MIT's campus is the [Alchemist](https://listart.mit.edu/public-art-map/alchemist) by [Jaume Plensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaume_Plensa). Plensa has created a number of similar sister figures throughout the world ([*House of Memory*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/house-of-memory-2012), [*Singapore Soul*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/soul-2011), [*El Alma del Ebro*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/el-alma-del-ebro-2008), [*Nomade*](http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/nomade-2007)). However, the one at MIT is unique in its formation of a thinking man with numbers and mathematical symbols, as opposed to letters of the alphabet. My Alchemist design combines this well-recognized landmark of MIT with symbols of Islam, by replacing the mathematical symbols with Arabic letters.

My next step was to transform this idea into an actual design. I had never used Illustrator before, so I learned as I went along. Luckily, the Alchemist design ended up being fairly straightforward. I first created a [clipping mask](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/clipping-masks.html) from an image of the Alchemist's profile and overlaid it on a black background. 

Next I had to add the Arabic characters. I tested several different Arabic fonts, ranging from more calligraphic like Waseem to more playful like [Farah Regular](https://www.fonts.com/font/diwan-software/farah/regular). I simply inserted, transformed, and rotated individual characters onto the mask. Finally, I used the [paintbrush tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/brushes.html#paintbrush_tool_options) with a rounded tip to freehand "MSA" in [MIT's red color](http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/colors.html). I opted to freehand the lettering to create a casual and playful vibe.

With a few more adjustments and feedback, like [smoothing the path](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/editing-paths.html), the final Alchemist logo was ready:
