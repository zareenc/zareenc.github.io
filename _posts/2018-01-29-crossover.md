This mural - "Crossover" - now adorns the walls of my dorm room. For context, my dorm, [Burton Conner](http://burton-conner.mit.edu/), allows residents to paint murals in the hallways and rooms. I've previously painted two other murals in our dorm, but it's been a while since I last picked up a paint brush, and I was itching to make another one. Plus, I hadn't painted one on my own before, so this was my opportunity to do so.

You may recognize some of the silhouettes in the mural, which hark from some of my favorite animated series. From left to right, they are: Tina, Louise, and Gene from [_Bob's Burgers_](https://www.fox.com/bobs-burgers/); Bojack and Sarah Lynn from [_Bojack Horseman_](https://www.netflix.com/title/70300800/); and Rick and Morty from [_Rick and Morty_](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty). I originally conceived the idea for this mural from [this picture](https://www.deviantart.com/jurokoo/art/Rick-and-Morty-Background-no-1-634512909), which I believe is a twist on [this well-recognized _Calvin and Hobbes_ image](https://wallup.net/calvin-and-hobbes-space-stars/). I took the basic concept, replaced the original galactic content with a different beast created by my mind, and collided Rick and Morty's universe with Bob Belcher's and Bojack Horseman's. Thus, "Crossover" was formed. 

Below is a progression of the making of the mural. Enjoy!
