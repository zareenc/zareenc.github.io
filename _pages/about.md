Hi there! My name is Zareen Choudhury, and I'm an undergraduate at MIT in the Class of 2018. I'm majoring in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) (Course 6-2) with a humanities concentration in Education (Course 11). I'm most interested in computer systems, with applications to robotics and machine learning. 

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher in the [Distributed Robotics Lab](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) under Daniela Rus in CSAIL. Previously, I've interned at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/), and [NASA Goddard](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). I was also an undergraduate Lab Assistant for [6.004](https://6004.mit.edu/) (Computation Structures).

Outside of class, I've been involved in various organizations. I helped run [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org/) & [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackmit.org/), led a STEM outreach program with the [Society of Women Engineers](http://swe.mit.edu/), and am a camp counselor for MIT's chapter of [Camp Kesem](http://campkesem.org/).
