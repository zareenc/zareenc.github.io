Hi there! My name is Zareen Choudhury. I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) from MIT, and I'm joining [Samsara](https://www.samsara.com/) full-time in Fall 2019. My Master's [thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Thesis_Final.pdf) was completed in Dina Katabi's [Networks at MIT](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/wordpress/) group, where I developed a configuration system for WiTrack, an RF-based IoT device for real-time health monitoring. 

Previously, I was a member of Daniela Rus' [Distributed Robotics Lab](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) in CSAIL, where I worked on a cloud robotics platform. I also interned at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/), and [NASA Goddard](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard), and was a Teaching Assistant for [6.004](https://6004.mit.edu/) (Computation Structures) under Chris Terman.

Outside of school, I was involved in various campus organizations at MIT: I helped run [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org/) & [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackmit.org/), led a STEM outreach program with the [Society of Women Engineers](http://swe.mit.edu/), and was a camp counselor for [Camp Kesem](http://campkesem.org/).
