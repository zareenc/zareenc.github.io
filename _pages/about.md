Hi there! My name is Zareen Choudhury, and I'm a Master's student at MIT in [Dina Katabi's](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/) [Networks group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/wordpress/). For my undergraduate education, I graduated from MIT in June 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) (Course 6-2) and a humanities concentration in Education (Course 11). I'm interested in computer systems with applications to IoT devices, robotics, and machine learning. 

Previously, I've been an undergraduate researcher in Daniela Rus' [Distributed Robotics Lab](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) in CSAIL and an intern at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/), and [NASA Goddard](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). I was also a Teaching Assistant for [6.004](https://6004.mit.edu/) (Computation Structures).

Outside of academics and research, I've been involved in various campus organizations: I helped run [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org/) & [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackmit.org/), led a STEM outreach program with the [Society of Women Engineers](http://swe.mit.edu/), and was a camp counselor for MIT's chapter of [Camp Kesem](http://campkesem.org/).
